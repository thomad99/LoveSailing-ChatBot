LOGO INSTRUCTIONS

To complete the setup of the "Love Sailing" logo:

1. Save the "Love Sailing" logo image as "lovesailing-logo.png" in this directory (/src/public/img/).

2. The logo should have a transparent background to look best against the dark blue banner (#020053).

3. The recommended dimensions are around 300px width to fit properly in the banner.

4. If you don't have the exact logo shown in the example, any sailing-related logo with "Love Sailing" text will work well.

5. Make sure the image is in PNG format with the exact filename "lovesailing-logo.png" to match the references in the HTML files.

Note: All three pages (upload.html, chat.html, and 404.html) are configured to use this logo in the banner.
